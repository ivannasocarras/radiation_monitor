*** Application Overview ***
This system is designed to monitor the radiation levels on a space system using the 
analog sensor, if the sensor reads a value that goes over the threshold an alert is
printed showing an overexposure and a red LED blinks once. The button works
to change the system mode between normal, energy saving and emergency. Each system 
mode affects how often the sensor message is printed.
